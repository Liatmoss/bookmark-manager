# Bookmark Manager

## User Stories
```
As a User
So that I can go to websites I regularly visit
I want to see the bookmarks in a list
```


When the user visits the '/bookmarks' path, their browser sends a request to a controller we built.
When the controller gets the request, it asks the Bookmark class to give it all the bookmarks, i.e. the controller asks for Bookmark.all.
The Bookmark class goes and gets the bookmarks, and gives back all the bookmarks in an array to the controller.
The controller renders the array of bookmarks to a webpage, which it sends as a response to the user.
